**Contact Application**  This Android application is a simple contact management system built using Android Studio. It leverages modern Android development practices and architectural patterns to provide a seamless user experience for managing contacts.

**Features**
**MVVM Architecture**: The application follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, separating the UI, business logic, and data layers for better maintainability and testability.

**Data Binding:** Data binding is utilized to establish a connection between UI components in the layout and the application's data sources, reducing boilerplate code and improving code readability.

**Retrofit for API Calls:** Retrofit, a type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java, is employed for making API calls to fetch and manipulate contact data from a remote server. This ensures efficient network communication and seamless data retrieval.

**Single Activity Architecture:** The application adopts a single activity architecture, where different fragments are used to represent various screens or functionalities. This promotes a modular and reusable codebase while optimizing memory usage and improving navigation flow.

**Usage**
Before using the application, please ensure that your device has an active internet connection. The application relies on network connectivity to fetch and update contact information from the server.
